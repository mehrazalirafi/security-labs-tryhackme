# Cryptography: Core Concepts

## 📌 Non-repudiation
- **Definition:** Ensures that someone cannot deny the validity of their actions or statements.
- **Example:** Signing a contract ensures non-repudiation — the signer cannot deny having signed it.
- **Cryptographic Relevance:**
  - Proves **you really signed** the message.
  - Others can **see and verify** your signature.
  - Adds **proof of integrity** and **origin**.

## 📌 Proof of Integrity
- **Goal:** Ensure data has **not changed** during transit or storage.
- **Method:** Use **cryptographic hashes**.
  - Hash = Short string of text representing the data.
  - Examples: Message Digest, Fingerprint.
- **Key Property:** If the **data changes**, the **hash changes**.
- **Note:** Hashes do **not** identify people — only confirm data integrity.

## 📌 Hashing Example: Gutenberg Encyclopedia
- **Original File:** Gutenberg Encyclopedia Vol 1 (8.1 MB).
- **Original Hash:**
c7004997a9cff73f9c3423579be5e8577389b63b4b085e541d327903f99a09db
- **After Changing One Character:**
5c82dcc2e0f359b48fddd71f6ca4602941f5e21e26b2edc7bb43942eb715a1c1
- **Conclusion:** Even a **minor change** alters the entire hash, compromising **data integrity**.

---

## 📌 Proof of Origin
- **Goal:** Confirm that the message:
- Was **not modified** (integrity)
- Came from a **verified sender** (authentication)
- **Process:**
- Ensure the **signature is authentic** (non-repudiation).
- Sender signs with their **private key**.
- Receiver verifies using the **public key**.
- Any change to the message **invalidates the signature**.

## 🛠 Creating a Digital Signature
1. Write message (e.g., `You're hired, Bob`)
2. Generate hash of the message using a **hashing algorithm**
3. Encrypt the hash with sender’s **private key** → produces the **digital signature**
4. Send the **plaintext + signature**

---

## ✅ Verifying a Digital Signature
1. Receive plaintext and digital signature.
2. Use sender’s **public key** to decrypt the signature → get the original hash.
3. Hash the received plaintext yourself.
4. **Compare** both hashes:
 - If they match → message is **authentic** and **unchanged**.
 - If not → message has been **tampered with**.

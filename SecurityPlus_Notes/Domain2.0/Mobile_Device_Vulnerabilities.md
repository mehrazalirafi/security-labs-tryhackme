## ðŸ“± Mobile Device Security Challenges

- **Challenging to secure**: Require specialized policies, MDMs, and monitoring tools.
- **Small and portable**: Easy to lose or steal.
- **Always in motion**: Devices change networks and locations constantly.
- **Loaded with sensitive data**: Includes both personal and organizational information.
- **Always connected to the Internet**: Increases attack surface for remote exploits.

## ðŸ”“ Jailbreaking / Rooting

- **Purpose-built OS**: Devices are designed to restrict low-level access.
- **Rooting** (Android) / **Jailbreaking** (iOS):
  - Circumvents built-in security.
  - Installs custom firmware, replacing the original OS.
- **Uncontrolled access**:
  - Disables security features.
  - Renders Mobile Device Management (MDM) ineffective.

## ðŸ“¥ Sideloading Apps

- **Security risk**: Malicious apps may introduce backdoors or steal data.
- **Bypasses app store validation**:
  - Allows manual installation from untrusted sources.
- **Management tip**:
  - Restrict installations to approved app stores or company repositories.
- **Policy violation**: Often breaches Acceptable Use Policies (AUPs) and can result in termination.

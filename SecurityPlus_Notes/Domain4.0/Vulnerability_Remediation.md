# Vulnerability Remediation Strategies

## 1. Patching (Primary Mitigation)
- **Scheduled Patches**: Regular updates (monthly/quarterly)
- **Unscheduled Patches**: Emergency fixes for zero-day vulnerabilities
- **Ongoing Process**: Continuous patch management prevents most exploits

## 2. Cybersecurity Insurance
- **Coverage Includes**:
  - Lost revenue
  - Data recovery costs
  - Phishing losses
  - Privacy lawsuit expenses
- **Limitations**:
  - Excludes intentional acts/fund transfers
- **Ransomware Impact**: Increased adoption across organizations

## 3. Segmentation Strategies
| Type             | Implementation                          | Security Benefits                          |
|------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Physical**     | Separate devices/infrastructure        | Complete isolation (air gaps)             |
| **Logical (VLAN)**| Virtual segmentation on same hardware | - Limits exploit scope<br>- Requires L3 routing between VLANs |
| **NGFW Internal**| Next-Gen Firewalls between segments    | - Blocks unwanted cross-VLAN traffic<br>- Detects internal malicious activity |

## 4. Compensating Controls
- **When Patching Isn't Possible**:
  - Disable vulnerable services
  - Revoke application access
  - Restrict external access
  - Implement software firewalls/ACLs
- **Temporary Solution**: Provides coverage until permanent fix

## 5. Exceptions and Exemptions
- **Formal Process Required**:
  - Security committee approval
  - Risk-based justification
- **Acceptable Cases**:
  - Vulnerabilities requiring physical access
  - Mission-critical systems with patch conflicts
- **Balancing Act**: Service availability vs. security risk

## 6. Remediation Validation
1. **Rescanning**: Comprehensive vulnerability scan
2. **Audit**: Verify patch deployment across systems
3. **Verification**: Manual confirmation of security effectiveness
- **Critical Question**: "Does the patch actually stop the exploit?"

## 7. Continuous Reporting
- **Essential Metrics**:
  - Identified vs. patched vulnerabilities
  - New threat notifications
  - Exception/exemption tracking
  - Patch deployment errors
- **Automation Requirement**: Manual tracking impractical at scale

## Key Takeaways
1. **Patch First**: Primary defense against known vulnerabilities
2. **Defense-in-Depth**: Combine segmentation, NGFW, and compensating controls
3. **Risk-Based Decisions**: Formal exceptions for justified cases
4. **Verify Everything**: Never assume patching was successful
5. **Metrics Matter**: Comprehensive reporting enables continuous improvement

# Security Awareness Training Summary

## Core Principles
- **Pre-Access Training**: Mandatory security training before network/system access
- **Role-Specific Content**: Customized training for different departments/functions
- **Third-Party Inclusion**: Contractors, partners, and suppliers must complete training
- **Documentation**: Maintain records of completed training for compliance/audits

## Training Components
### Policy & Handbook Integration
- Centralized security policy documentation
- Online policy repositories
- Employee handbook references

### Threat Recognition
- **Digital Threats**:
  - Phishing emails (links/attachments)
  - Suspicious URLs/texts
- **Physical Threats**:
  - Unknown USB devices
  - Unsecured building access points
- **Situational Awareness**: Constant vigilance mindset

### Critical Focus Areas
1. **Insider Threat Mitigation**:
   - Multi-person approval for critical processes
   - File/system change monitoring
   - Restricted change authorization

2. **Password Management**:
   - Enforced standards (length, complexity)
   - Technical enforcement (e.g., Group Policy)
   - Regular credential updates

3. **Removable Media Risks**:
   - USB drive malware threats
   - Malicious charging cables
   - "Never plug in unknown devices" policy

4. **Social Engineering Defense**:
   - Ongoing training updates
   - Real-world attack simulations
   - Reporting procedures

### Special Environments
- **Hybrid/Remote Work**:
  - Family/friend access restrictions
  - Enhanced endpoint security
  - Strict VPN usage policies
- **Operational Security (OPSEC)**:
  - Adversary perspective training
  - Sensitive data identification
  - Data minimization practices

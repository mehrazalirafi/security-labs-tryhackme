## üìå Key Notes

- ‚úÖ Controls may span multiple **categories** or **types**.
- üîÅ Controls evolve with changing **technology**.
- üß± Strong security uses **multiple overlapping controls** for defense-in-depth.
- üßë‚Äçüíº Directive controls are **weakest** as they rely on human behavior without enforcement.
- ‚õë Compensating controls are **temporary** workarounds until full protection is restored.

# Summary of Security Policies and Frameworks

## Core Security Policies
1. **Security Policy Guidelines**  
   - Establishes rules for CIA (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability)  
   - High-level strategies (data storage, incident procedures)  
   - Detailed goals (Wi-Fi usage, remote access)  
   - Defines "what" and "why" (technical controls handle "how")

2. **Information Security Policies**  
   - Centralized repository of all security policies  
   - Ensures compliance with legal/regulatory requirements  
   - Defines incident response procedures and role responsibilities  
   - Requires organizational enforcement to be effective  

3. **Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)**  
   - Defines permitted use of company assets (devices, networks)  
   - Covers internet, phones, computers, mobile devices  
   - Limits legal liability and provides grounds for disciplinary action  

## Business Resilience
4. **Business Continuity**  
   - Plans for technology disruptions (manual processes, paper backups)  
   - Requires pre-disaster documentation and testing  

5. **Disaster Recovery Plan**  
   - IT-focused continuity planning  
   - Addresses natural disasters, system failures, human errors  
   - Includes recovery sites, data restoration methods, team availability  

## Incident Management
6. **Security Incidents**  
   - Common scenarios: malware execution, DDoS attacks, data theft  
   - Requires predefined response procedures  

7. **Incident Response Roles**  
   - Specialized response team (trained/tested)  
   - IT management, compliance officers, technical staff  
   - User community as frontline observers  

8. **NIST SP800-61 Framework**  
   - Incident lifecycle:  
     - Preparation → Detection/Analysis → Containment/Eradication → Recovery → Post-Incident Review  

## Development & Change Management
9. **Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)**  
   - Structured approach from concept to deployment  
   - Balances requirements, schedule, and budget  
   - **Agile** vs **Waterfall** methodologies:  
     - Waterfall: Linear (Requirements→Design→Develop→Test→Deploy)  
     - Agile: Iterative cycles with continuous feedback  

10. **Change Management**  
    - Formal process for system modifications (upgrades, config changes)  
    - Mitigates organizational risk through:  
      - Scheduled changes with fallback procedures  
      - Documentation of duration/installation processes  
    - Challenges: Cultural adoption and consistent implementation

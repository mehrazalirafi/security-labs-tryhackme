# Keyloggers, Logic Bombs, and Rootkits

## Keyloggers
- **Capture valuable input**: Keystrokes can include login URLs, usernames, passwords, emails, credit card details, and more.
- **Bypass encryption**: Even if files or network traffic are encrypted, keyloggers log input before encryption occurs.
- **Types of logged data**:
  - Clipboard contents
  - Screen captures
  - Instant messages
  - Search engine queries
- **Tool example**: DarkComet Remote Access Trojan (RAT) is shown in action capturing keystrokes and displaying logs in real time.

## Logic Bombs
- **Triggered by events**:
  - **Time bombs**: Activate on a specific date/time.
  - **User events**: Activated by actions such as user logins.
- **Hard to detect**: No signature, not reused, often customized by attacker.
- **Historical example**:
  - **March 19â€“20, 2013 (South Korea)**:
    - Trojan sent via bank-themed email.
    - Logic bomb deleted boot records and storage at 2 PM.
    - ATMs rebooted to no OS, showing "Boot device not found".

## Preventing Logic Bombs
- **Difficult to recognize**: Each instance is unique.
- **Mitigation strategies**:
  - **Process controls**: Formal change control and limited admin rights.
  - **Electronic monitoring**: Host-based intrusion detection, file integrity monitoring (e.g., Tripwire).
  - **Regular audits**: Monitor access rights and privileges.

## Rootkits
- **Origin**: Name from Unix "root" (admin) access.
- **Behavior**:
  - Modify kernel-level files (core OS functions).
  - Operate invisibly to OS and traditional antivirus.
- **Detection and Removal**:
  - **Scan for anomalies** using anti-malware.
  - **Specialized removers**: Created per rootkit variant.
  - **Secure Boot with UEFI**: BIOS-level check ensures OS kernel integrity before boot.

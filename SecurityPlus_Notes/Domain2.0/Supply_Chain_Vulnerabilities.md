## 🔗 Supply Chain and Provider Risks

---

### 🧱 Supply Chain Risk
- **Complex Process**: Involves raw materials, suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, customers, and consumers.
- **Attack Vectors**: Attackers can target any step; suppliers are often blindly trusted.
- **Chain Reaction**: A single exploit can compromise the entire supply chain.

---

### 🛠️ Service Providers
- **Control Limitations**: You manage your own security, not the provider's.
- **Access Risks**: Service providers may have internal system access — potential for abuse.
- **Variety of Providers**: Includes IT, cleaning, payroll, cloud, utilities, etc.
- **Best Practice**: Include ongoing **security audits** in provider contracts.

- **Lesson**: Non-IT service providers can become serious security risks.

### 🖥️ Hardware Providers
- **Trust Issues**: Devices like switches, routers, firewalls may be compromised.
- **Small Vendor Pool**: Tighter control and vetting of fewer suppliers is safer.
- **Security by Design**: Policies, procedures, and distrust-by-default are essential.

### ❓ Cisco or Not Cisco?
- **Network Core Devices**: Routers and switches are critical visibility points.
- **Counterfeit Case**: DHS arrested a CEO (2022) for selling $1B+ in fake Cisco products since 2013.
- **Danger**: Devices were knock-offs from China — some even caught fire.

### 💽 Software Providers
- **Trust = Foundation of Security**
- **Initial Install**: Validate digital signatures during setup.
- **Updates**: Auto-updates are convenient but need trust.
- **Open Source**: Even OSS can be compromised — malicious contributors exist.

# Disaster Recovery and Continuity Testing Overview

This video covers various testing strategies to ensure an organization's disaster recovery and system availability plans are effective and efficient.

---

## 1. Recovery Testing

- **Purpose**: Validate the disaster recovery plan before an actual event.
- **Frequency**: Should be scheduled regularly (annual, semi-annual).
- **Rules of Engagement**:
  - Avoid interaction with production systems.
- **Approach**:
  - Simulate a specific disaster scenario.
  - Use a predefined timeframe.
- **Post-Test Evaluation**:
  - Document the outcomes.
  - Discuss and revise the recovery plan if needed.

## 2. Tabletop Exercises

- **Benefits**:
  - Cost-effective and less time-consuming than full-scale drills.
- **Method**:
  - Simulate a disaster using discussion and analysis, not physical execution.
  - Involve key stakeholders to walk through the response plan.
- **Outcome**:
  - Identify missing elements or issues in recovery logistics.

## 3. Failover Testing

- **Concept**: Redundancy ensures continuity during hardware/software failure.
- **Preparation**:
  - Implement redundant routers, switches, firewalls, and internet connections.
- **Execution**:
  - Test to ensure failover happens seamlessly and automatically.
  - Users should remain unaware of the failover during the test.
- **Tools**:
  - Devices and software that support failover natively.

## 4. Simulation Testing

- **Example Scenarios**:
  - Phishing attacks
  - Password resets
  - Data exfiltration
- **Phishing Simulation**:
  - Send crafted phishing emails to employees.
  - Monitor who clicks (user testing) and if the email bypasses filters (system testing).
- **Follow-up**:
  - Provide additional training to users who fail the test.

## 5. Parallel Processing

- **Definition**:
  - Distributes workload across multiple CPUs or machines.
- **Advantages**:
  - Increased performance through concurrent transaction processing.
  - Enhances recovery by isolating faulty systems and maintaining operations with remaining units.

# ðŸ“Š Gap Analysis in Information Security

---

## 1. What is a Gap Analysis?

- Compares **where you are** vs **where you want to be**.
- The "gap" = difference between your current and desired state.
- Requires **extensive research**, technical study, and stakeholder input.
- Can take **weeks or months** due to data collection and analysis.

---

## 2. Choosing the Right Framework

- **Start with a baseline**: Could be internal goals or formal industry standards.
- **Use formal standards** when necessary:
  - **NIST SP 800-171 Rev 2**: Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI).
  - **ISO/IEC 27001**: Standard for Information Security Management Systems (ISMS).

---

## 3. Evaluating People and Processes

- **Assess employee capabilities**:
  - Formal experience
  - Training level
  - Knowledge of security policies and procedures
- **Examine current operations**:
  - IT infrastructure
  - Existing security policies and implementation

---

## 4. Compare and Contrast

- **Comparison** of current vs desired state.
- **Identify weaknesses** and highlight effective processes.
- **Perform detailed analysis**:
  - Break down broad domains into smaller, manageable components.

## 5. Control Mapping Example: Access Control

| NIST 800-171 | NIST 800-53 | ISO/IEC 27001       | Description                                                  |
|--------------|--------------|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| 3.1.1        | AC-2         | A.9.2.1              | User registration and de-registration                        |
| 3.1.2        | AC-2         | A.9.2.2 â€“ A.9.2.6    | Access provisioning, privilege management, user access review|

---

## 6. Final Analysis and Report

- The **final comparison** shows the gap from current state to objective.
- Define a **clear roadmap**: what needs to be done, cost, time.
- Create the **Gap Analysis Report**:
  - Describes the **current state**
  - Recommends **actions** to meet the baseline

---

## 7. Visual Overview

A gap analysis dashboard might include:

- **Rows** = Security requirements (e.g., Access Control, Risk Assessment)
- **Columns** = Locations or departments
- **Cells** = Color-coded status (e.g., ðŸŸ© compliant, ðŸŸ¨ partially compliant, ðŸŸ¥ non-compliant)

---

## âœ… Summary

Gap analysis is a structured process to:

- Understand your **security maturity**
- Align with **industry standards**
- **Plan improvements** based on gaps identified

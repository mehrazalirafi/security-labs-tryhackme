#  Gap Analysis in Information Security

## 1. What is a Gap Analysis?
- Compares **where you are** vs **where you want to be**.
- The "gap" is the difference between your current and desired state.
- Requires **extensive research**, technical study, and stakeholder input.
- Can take **weeks or months** due to data collection and analysis.

---

## 2. Choosing the Right Framework
- **Start with a baseline**: Could be internal goals or formal industry standards.
- **Use formal standards** when necessary:
  - **NIST SP 800-171 Rev 2**: Focused on protecting Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI).
  - **ISO/IEC 27001**: International standard for information security management systems (ISMS).

---

## 3. Evaluating People and Processes
- **Assess employee capabilities**:
  - Formal experience
  - Training level
  - Knowledge of security policies and procedures
- **Examine current operations**:
  - IT infrastructure
  - Existing security policies and implementation

---

## 4. Compare and Contrast
- **Comparison** of current vs desired state.
- **Identify weaknesses** and recognize strong, effective processes.
- **Perform detailed analysis**:
  - Break down broad security domains into smaller, manageable components.

---

## 5. Control Mapping Example: Access Control
Based on **NIST SP 800-171** and **ISO/IEC 27001** mappings:
| NIST 800-171 | NIST 800-53 | ISO/IEC 27001 | Description |
|--------------|--------------|----------------|-------------|
| 3.1.1 | AC-2 | A.9.2.1 | User registration and de-registration |
| 3.1.2 | AC-2 | A.9.2.2 â€“ A.9.2.6 | Access provisioning, privilege management, user access review |

---

## 6. Final Analysis and Report
- The **final comparison** shows how far your current state is from the objective.
- Define a clear **roadmap**: What needs to be done, how much it costs, how long it takes.
- Create the **Gap Analysis Report**:
  - Describes the current state
  - Recommends actions to meet the baseline

---

## 7. Visual Overview
A gap analysis dashboard might include:
- Rows = Security requirements (e.g., Access Control, Risk Assessment)
- Columns = Locations or departments
- Cells = Color-coded status (e.g., green = compliant, yellow = partially compliant, red = non-compliant)

---

## Summary
Gap analysis is a structured process to:
- Understand your **security maturity**
- Align with **industry standards**
- **Plan improvements** based on gaps identified

# Summary of Security Standards and Controls

## Foundational Standards
1. **Security Standards**  
   - Formal definitions for security technologies and processes  
   - Reduce risk through comprehensive documentation  
   - Sources:  
     - In-house development (unique requirements)  
     - Established frameworks (ISO, NIST)  

## Authentication & Access
2. **Password Policies**  
   - Formal complexity requirements  
   - Approved authentication methods (e.g., LDAP/AD only)  
   - Secure password reset procedures  
   - Additional controls:  
     - Change frequency  
     - Storage requirements  
     - Password manager guidelines  

3. **Access Control Standards**  
   - Governs data access: what, when, and under what conditions  
   - Specifies control types (e.g., mandatory vs. discretionary)  
   - Defines:  
     - Privilege assignment processes  
     - Access revocation procedures (security issues, contract expiration)  

## Physical & Data Security
4. **Physical Security Policies**  
   - Building/property access rules  
   - Differentiated access: employees vs. visitors  
   - System requirements:  
     - Electronic locks  
     - Continuous monitoring  
     - Motion detection  
   - Special provisions:  
     - Mandatory escorts  
     - Off-boarding procedures  

5. **Encryption Standards**  
   - Cryptographic implementation guidelines  
   - Password storage methods (e.g., salted hashes)  
   - Data encryption minimums per state:  
     - **Data at rest**: Storage encryption  
     - **Data in transit**: Network encryption  
     - **Data in use**: Processing protections  
   - Algorithm specifications for each state

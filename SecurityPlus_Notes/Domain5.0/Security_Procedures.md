# Summary of Security Procedures and Governance

## Operational Processes
1. **Change Management**  
   - Formal process to prevent downtime/errors  
   - Key steps:  
     - Scope definition → Risk analysis → Planning → Approval  
     - Change control board review → Backout planning → Documentation  

2. **Onboarding**  
   - New hire/transfer integration process:  
     - IT agreements signed (AUP/handbook)  
     - Account creation with proper permissions  
     - Preconfigured hardware provisioning (laptops, tablets)  

3. **Offboarding**  
   - Pre-planned exit procedures:  
     - Hardware retrieval  
     - Data disposition planning  
     - Account deactivation (vs. deletion)  

## Security Automation
4. **Playbooks**  
   - Conditional response procedures (e.g., data breach, ransomware)  
   - Manual checklists → Automated workflows  
   - SOAR integration:  
     - Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response  
     - Third-party tool consolidation  

5. **Monitoring & Revision**  
   - Continuous security evolution:  
     - Security posture updates (tighter controls, new playbooks)  
     - Procedure refinement (additional checks)  
     - Emerging threat adaptation  

## Governance Frameworks
6. **Governance Structures**  
   - **Boards**: Specialists setting committee tasks  
   - **Committees**: SMEs executing board directives  
   - **Government Entities**: Unique requirements (legal, political, public access)  

7. **Governance Models**  
   - **Centralized**: Single decision-making group  
   - **Decentralized**: Distributed decision authority  
   - Selection based on organizational needs

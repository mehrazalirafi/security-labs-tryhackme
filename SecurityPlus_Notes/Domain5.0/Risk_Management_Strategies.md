| **Transfer**      | Move risk to another party                                                 | Purchasing cybersecurity insurance                                      |
| **Accept**        | Consciously decide to retain risk (most common approach)                   | Business decision to proceed despite known risks                        |
| **Avoid**         | Eliminate risk by discontinuing high-risk activities                        | Stopping use of vulnerable software/service                             |
| **Mitigate**      | Reduce risk likelihood/impact                                              | Implementing next-generation firewalls                                  |

## Specialized Acceptance Approaches
- **Accept with Exemption**  
  - *For regulatory/policy conflicts*  
  - Requires formal approval (e.g., unpatched manufacturing equipment exempted from update policy when isolated from network)  
  - Based on: Security controls, organization size, asset value  

- **Accept with Exception**  
  - *Temporary policy suspension*  
  - Time-bound justification (e.g., extending 3-day patch window when updates break critical software)  
  - Requires documented business justification

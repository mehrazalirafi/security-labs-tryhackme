# Capacity Planning and Resource Management

## Capacity Planning
- Goal: Match supply to demand, though it's not always a clear equation.
- **Too Much Demand**: Leads to application slowdowns or outages.
- **Too Much Supply**: Results in wasted resources and higher costs.
- Solution: A **balanced approach**:
  - Right number of people
  - Appropriate technology
  - Efficient infrastructure

## People
- Some services (e.g., call centers, tech support) require human interaction.
- **Too Few Employees**: May lead to hiring delays and service disruption.
- **Too Many Employees**: May require redeployment or downsizing.

## Technology
- Choose scalable technologies that adapt to load.
- **Web Services**: Load balancers can distribute demand across multiple servers.
- **Database Services**: Use clustering and database splitting to increase capacity.
- **Cloud Services**: Offer on-demand scaling, but cost increases with usage.

## Infrastructure
- Consists of application servers, network, CPU, storage, etc.
- **Physical Devices**: Must be purchased, configured, and installed manually.
- **Cloud-Based Devices**: Easier to deploy and scale for unpredictable changes.

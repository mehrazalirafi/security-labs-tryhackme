# Physical and Environmental Attacks

## Physical Attacks
- **Old-school security**:
  - Remove input peripherals (keyboard, mouse).
- **Bypass digital defenses**:
  - Physical access circumvents OS and software security.
- **Key principle**: 
  - "If you have physical access to a server, you have full control."
- **Locks deter honest people**:
  - Skilled attackers can always find a way in.

## Brute Force (Physical)
- **Direct physical aggression**:
  - No password needed—kick, break, or pry entryways.
- **Evaluate physical security**:
  - Inspect windows, doors, and barriers.
- **Preparation is critical**:
  - Expect attackers to try anything.

## RFID Cloning
- **RFID use cases**:
  - Door access badges and key fobs.
- **Ease of cloning**:
  - Tools available online for <$50.
  - Fast process—read and write in seconds.
- **Mitigation**:
  - Use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) with the card.

## Environmental Attacks
- **Target infrastructure**:
  - Power, HVAC, fire systems.
- **Power disruption**:
  - Shutting off power causes downtime.
- **HVAC attacks**:
  - Overheat servers to trigger shutdowns.
- **Fire suppression abuse**:
  - Can be used to cause false alarms or system damage.

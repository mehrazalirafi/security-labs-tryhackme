# Vulnerability Management Fundamentals

## 1. Dealing with False Information
- **False Positives**  
  - Vulnerability reported that doesn't actually exist
  - Different from low-severity valid vulnerabilities
- **False Negatives**  
  - Real vulnerability exists but goes undetected (more dangerous)
- **Mitigation Strategies**:
  - Update scanning signatures regularly
  - Collaborate with scanning vendors for environment-specific updates

## 2. Vulnerability Prioritization
- **Key Considerations**:
  - Not all vulnerabilities have equal impact
  - Critical vs. low-severity distinctions
- **Prioritization Resources**:
  - Public vulnerability databases
  - Industry discussion groups
  - Disclosure mailing lists

## 3. Vulnerability Scoring Systems
| System       | Purpose                                                                 | Key Features                                                                 |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **CVSS**     | Quantitative vulnerability scoring (0-10 scale)                         | - Version-specific (CVSS 2.0 vs 3.x)<br>- Industry standard for severity rating |
| **CVE**      | Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures database                           | - Standardized vulnerability identifiers<br>- Cross-referenced across platforms |
| **NVD**      | National Vulnerability Database (nvd.nist.gov)                          | - Synchronized with CVE<br>- Enhanced search functionality                   |

## 4. Vulnerability Classification
- **Scanning Types**:
  - **Application Scans**: Desktop/mobile apps (e.g., WhatsApp CVE-2020-1889)
  - **Web App Scans**: Server-based software (e.g., UCMS CVE-2020-24851)
  - **Network Scans**: Firewalls, open ports, devices (e.g., D-Link CVE-2020-25079)
- **Limitations**: Signature-based detection requires constant updates

## 5. Risk Assessment Factors
- **Exposure Factor**:
  - Percentage impact if exploited (e.g., 50% for partial outage, 100% for complete failure)
- **Environmental Variables**:
  - Public cloud vs. isolated test lab
  - Revenue-generating systems vs. internal tools
  - External vs. internal user access
- **Organizational Impact**:
  - Healthcare: Tallahassee Memorial ransomware (2-week shutdown)
  - Utilities: DDoS attacks on power grids (Salt Lake City/LA County)

## 6. Risk Tolerance & Patching Strategy
- **Definition**: Acceptable risk level for an organization
- **Patching Dilemma**:
  - Immediate patching vs. testing requirements
  - Vulnerability window during testing
- **Balanced Approach**:
  - Critical vulnerabilities: Expedited testing
  - Lower-risk issues: Standard testing cycles
  - Environment-based prioritization (public > internal > lab)

## Key Takeaways
1. **Validation is Crucial**: Distinguish false positives from true vulnerabilities
2. **Context Matters**: Prioritize based on CVSS, exposure factor, and business impact
3. **Patch Strategically**: Balance speed vs. stability based on risk tolerance
4. **Maintain References**: Utilize CVE/NVD for accurate vulnerability intelligence

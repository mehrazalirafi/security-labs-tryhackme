# 🔐 Zero Trust Architecture – Summary Notes

---

## Zero Trust

- **Networks are often open** internally after bypassing the firewall.
- **Zero Trust** is a comprehensive security model:
  - Applies to every device, process, and person.
  - Assumes **nothing is trusted** by default.
- Requires **verification for everything**:
  - Techniques: MFA, encryption, access controls, firewalls, monitoring, analytics.

---

## 🧱 Planes of Operation

- **Networks are split into functional planes**:
  - Applies across physical, virtual, and cloud infrastructure.

### Data Plane
- Handles **packets, frames, and traffic**.
- Tasks: forwarding, trunking, encrypting, NAT.

### Control Plane
- Makes decisions about **how data is handled**.
- Sets rules and policies:
  - Routing tables, NAT tables, session management.

### Extend the Physical Architecture
- Devices (e.g., firewalls) separate tasks physically:
  - **Control Plane**: manages and configures.
  - **Data Plane**: handles data forwarding.

## 🎛️ Controlling Trust

### Adaptive Identity
- Considers: IP, location, device, relationship to organization.
- Increases authentication strictness if risk is high.

### Threat Scope Reduction
- Fewer trust boundaries reduce the attack surface.

### Policy-Driven Access Control
- Based on a **predefined ruleset** and contextual identity.

---

## 🛡️ Security Zones

- **Broad groupings** for access management.
- **Origin and destination** are key:
  - Trusted / Untrusted
  - VPNs, departments (HR, IT, etc.)
- **Zones can allow or block traffic by default**.
- Example: block `Untrusted → Trusted`, allow `Trusted → Internal`.

---

## 🚦 Policy Enforcement Point (PEP)

- Evaluates access requests.
- Controls connections between subjects and resources.
- Enforces decisions made by policy systems.

---

## 🧠 Applying Trust in the Planes

### Policy Decision Point (PDP)

- **Policy Engine**:
  - Evaluates rules and external data.
  - Grants, denies, or revokes access.

- **Policy Administrator**:
  - Talks to PEP.
  - Issues access tokens or credentials.

---

## 🔄 Zero Trust Across Planes

- **Control Plane** manages PDP logic.
- **Data Plane** handles traffic through PEP.

### Workflow:
1. Subject requests resource.
2. PEP checks with PDP.
3. Access is allowed or denied based on trust policies.

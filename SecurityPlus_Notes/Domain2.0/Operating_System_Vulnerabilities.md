# 🖥️ Operating Systems and Security

## Foundational Platform
- Every device uses an operating system, making it a **prime target** for attackers.
- OS platforms are the **foundation** of all computing—compromising the OS means compromising everything above it.

## Complexity Breeds Vulnerabilities
- OSes like Windows have **millions of lines of code**.
- More code → more opportunities for bugs and security issues.
- Many vulnerabilities **already exist**, but **haven’t been discovered yet**.

# 🔁 Monthly Update Cycle: Patch Tuesday

## Windows Updates
- **Patch Tuesday**: 2nd Tuesday of each month.
- Updates often include dozens of security patches.

## Example: May 9, 2023
- Nearly **50 security patches** released.
  - 8 Elevation of Privilege
  - 4 Security Feature Bypass
  - 12 Remote Code Execution
  - 8 Information Disclosure
  - 5 Denial of Service
  - 1 Spoofing
- Past updates (like April 2023) had even **more patches** (~100).

# ✅ Best Practices for OS Vulnerabilities

1. **Always Update**
   - Monthly or on-demand.
   - Delaying patches leaves systems vulnerable.
   - It’s a **race** between you and attackers.

2. **Test Before Deployment**
   - Especially in enterprise environments.
   - Some patches can break existing functionality.

3. **Prepare for Reboot**
   - Some updates require a restart to take effect.
   - Save all work and inform users beforehand.

4. **Have a Fallback Plan**
   - Always **back up your system**.
   - Be ready to roll back to a known good state if an update causes issues.

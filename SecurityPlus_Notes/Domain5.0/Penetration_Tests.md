# Penetration Testing Methodology Summary

## Physical Security Testing
- **Critical Vulnerability**: OS security bypass via physical access
- **Attack Vectors**:
  - Boot process modification
  - External media booting
  - OS file tampering/replacement
- **Defense Focus**:
  - Facility access control
  - Comprehensive physical security (doors, windows, elevators)
  - Process verification

## Testing Perspectives
| Team | Role | Primary Focus |
|------|------|---------------|
| **Red (Offensive)** | Attack simulation | Vulnerability exploitation |
| **Blue (Defensive)** | Real-time protection | Attack prevention & detection |
| **Integrated Approach** | Continuous improvement | Patch → Test → Validate cycle |

## Environment Knowledge Levels
- **Known Environment**: Full system disclosure
- **Partially Known**: Limited system/application focus
- **Unknown (Blind)**: Zero prior knowledge

## Reconnaissance Techniques
### Passive Recon
- **Sources**:
  - Social media
  - Corporate websites
  - Online forums (Reddit)
  - Business directories
- **Stealth Advantage**: Difficult to detect
- **Methods**:
  - Social engineering
  - Dumpster diving
  - Public record analysis

### Active Recon
- **Network-Visible Activities**:
  - Ping/port scans
  - DNS queries
  - OS fingerprinting
  - Service version scans
- **Evidence**: Loggable network traffic
- **Tactics**: "Door testing" without exploitation

## Key Workflow
1. **Footprinting**: Digital footprint analysis
2. **Security Posture Assessment**: Firewall/config review
3. **Target Prioritization**: Focus on critical systems
4. **Network Mapping**: Infrastructure visualization

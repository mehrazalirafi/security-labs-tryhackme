# Penetration Testing Overview

## 1. Penetration Testing Fundamentals
- **Definition**: Simulating real-world attacks on systems
- **Purpose**: 
  - Actively exploit vulnerabilities (beyond scanning)
  - Validate security controls
  - Meet compliance requirements (often requires 3rd-party testing)
- **NIST Reference**: [Technical Guide to Information Security Testing and Assessment]

## 2. Rules of Engagement
- **Critical document** defining test parameters:
  - Purpose and scope
  - Test types (physical breach, internal/external tests)
  - Scheduling constraints (business hours vs. after-hours)
  - IP ranges and systems in/out of scope
  - Emergency contacts
  - Sensitive data handling procedures

## 3. Vulnerability Exploitation Process
| Phase               | Key Activities                                                                 | Risks/Cautions                     |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Initial Access**  | - Password brute-forcing<br>- Social engineering<br>- Database injections     | - Potential system crashes        |
| **Lateral Movement**| - Pivot between internal systems<br>- Exploit internal trust relationships    | - Buffer overflow instability     |
| **Persistence**     | - Create backdoors<br>- Establish user accounts<br>- Modify default passwords | - Accidental data loss            |
| **Pivoting**        | - Use compromised systems as proxies<br>- Access restricted network segments  | - Overstepping test boundaries    |

## 4. Responsible Disclosure
- **Vulnerability Lifecycle**:
  1. Researcher discovers vulnerability
  2. Manufacturer develops patch
  3. Fix tested and deployed
  4. Vulnerability publicly disclosed (CVE)
- **Bug Bounty Programs**:
  - Financial rewards for ethical discovery
  - Controlled disclosure process
  - Incentivizes security research

## Key Takeaways
1. **Structured Approach**: Rules of engagement ensure safe, controlled testing
2. **Realistic Simulation**: Goes beyond scanning to actual exploitation
3. **Defense Validation**: Proves vulnerabilities are exploitable ("If we can get in, attackers can")
4. **Ethical Responsibility**: Proper disclosure protects all stakeholders

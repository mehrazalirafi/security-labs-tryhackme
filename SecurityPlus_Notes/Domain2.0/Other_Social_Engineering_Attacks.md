# Misinformation, Disinformation, and Brand Impersonation

## 🧠 Misinformation vs. Disinformation
- Both involve **spreading false information**, but:
  - **Misinformation**: Shared without intent to deceive
  - **Disinformation**: Shared **deliberately** to deceive

### Goals:
- Create **confusion** and **division**
- Run **influence campaigns** on politics and social issues
- Allow **nation-state actors** to divide, distract, and persuade
- Leverage **advertising** as a paid tool for influence
- Use **social media** to amplify the effect via shares, likes, and comments

1. **Create fake users**
2. **Generate content** that looks authentic

5. **Real users see and share it further**
6. **Mass media** may pick up the story due to popularity

## 🎭 Brand Impersonation Attacks

### How It Works:
- Pretend to be a trusted brand (e.g., **Apple, McDonald's, Coca-Cola**)
- Create **thousands of impersonated websites**
- Get indexed by **search engines** or embedded in **ads/messages**
- Users are tricked into visiting these sites

### User Experience:
- Pop-ups: “🎉 You won!” or “Special offer — download now!”
- Prompts users to install malicious software

### Consequences:
- **Malware infection** is highly likely
  - Adware, tracking scripts
  - **Data exfiltration** (stealing sensitive info)
  - **Credential harvesting**

# Physical Security Controls

## Barricades / Bollards
- **Prevent access**: Limits unauthorized entry; may not stop everything.
- **Channel people through access points**: Allow foot traffic, block vehicles.
- **Enhance safety**: Reduce risk of injury and designate security zones.
- **Extreme use**: Concrete barriers, moats, or other restrictive elements.

## Access Control Vestibules
- **All doors normally unlocked**: Opening one locks others.
- **All doors normally locked**: Unlocking one keeps others locked.
- **One door open / other locked**: Mutual exclusivity between door states.
- **One-at-a-time / controlled groups**: Single person or verified groups can enter.

## Fencing
- **Perimeter control**: Clearly marks restricted areas.
- **Transparent or opaque**: Visibility as needed for security.
- **Robust design**: Hard to cut or breach.
- **Climb prevention**: Razor wire or high build to deter access.

## Video Surveillance
- **CCTV**: Replaces or supplements human guards.
- **Camera features**:
  - Motion detection triggers alerts.
  - Object recognition (faces, license plates).
- **Multiple cameras**: Networked for broad, recorded coverage.

## Guards and Access Badges
- **Security guards**:
  - Provide physical security.
  - Verify identity.
- **Two-person control**: Prevent misuse or single-point failure.
- **Access badges**:
  - Show picture, name, details.
  - Worn at all times, electronically logged.

## Lighting
- **More light = more security**:
  - Deters attackers.
  - Aids visibility and camera clarity.
- **Specialized lighting**:
  - Optimal angles.
  - Facial recognition support.
  - Reduces shadows and glare.

## Sensors
- **Infrared**: Detects heat signatures, used in motion detection.
- **Pressure**: Monitors changes in force (floors/windows).
- **Microwave**: Covers large areas, detects movement.
- **Ultrasonic**: Uses reflected sound waves to detect motion or collisions.

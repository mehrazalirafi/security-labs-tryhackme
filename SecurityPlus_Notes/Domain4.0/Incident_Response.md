# Security Incident Response Summary

## Incident Response Lifecycle (NIST SP800-61)
1. **Preparation**  
   - Communication plans (contact lists, phones)  
   - Incident handling kits (forensic laptops, removable media, cameras)  
   - Documentation (network diagrams, baselines, file hashes)  
   - Clean OS/application images for recovery  

2. **Detection & Analysis**  
   - Sources: IDS/IPS alerts, AV reports, log anomalies  
   - Challenges: High attack volume, false positives, complexity  

3. **Containment, Eradication & Recovery**  
   - Isolation strategies (including sandboxing risks)  
   - Malware removal and vulnerability patching  
   - Account disablement and system restoration  

4. **Post-Incident Activity**  
   - Lessons learned meetings  
   - Process improvement documentation  
   - Timeline reconstruction  

## Common Security Incidents
- **Malware Infections**  
  Via email attachments or malicious downloads  
- **DDoS Attacks**  
  Botnet-driven network flooding  
- **Data Theft & Extortion**  
  Confidential information exfiltration  
- **Unauthorized Access**  
  P2P software misconfigurations exposing internal networks  

## Key Analysis Techniques
| Detection Method          | Example Indicators                     |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Log Analysis**          | Vulnerability scans in web server logs |
| **Network Monitoring**    | Abnormal traffic patterns/flows        |
| **Host-Based Detection**  | Unexpected configuration changes       |
| **Threat Intelligence**   | Exploit announcements (Patch Tuesday)  |

## Critical Response Considerations
- **Containment Challenges**  
  - Malware may detect isolation and self-destruct  
  - Balance between containment and evidence preservation  
- **Recovery Best Practices**  
  - Restore from trusted backups  
  - Rebuild compromised systems from scratch  
  - Tighten security perimeters post-recovery  
- **Post-Incident Questions**  
  - What exactly happened? (Timeline reconstruction)  
  - How effective were our response plans?  
  - What indicators should we monitor next time?  

## Training & Preparation
> "Limited on-the-job training exists during live incidents - prepare beforehand"  
- **Essential Training Areas**  
  - Initial response procedures  
  - Forensic investigation techniques  
  - Incident documentation/reporting  
- **Cost Considerations**  
  - Significant investment required for large teams  
  - Justified by reduced impact during actual incidents
